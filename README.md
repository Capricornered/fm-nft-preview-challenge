## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Useful resources

- [The Surprising Truth About Pixels and Accessibility](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/surprising-truth-about-pixels-and-accessibility/) - This wasn't necessarily referred to during working on this specific project but is something I think back to overall as I found it very informative in how/when to choose between pixels, ems, and rems.
